# Styles

All basic styles, variables, mixins and stuff are in the base folder.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS STAYS THE FIRST ALPHABETICAL FOLDER, so it can be imported first.

Note: files that begins with an underscore _ don't get automattically imported, and need to manually be imported (here in main.scss)

Put all component related styles in /components (one file per component),
and all pages specific related styles in /pages (one file per page).

Note: shame.scss must stay alone at styles'root folder, as it will be called last as folders will be processed first
